                                        <p>I am Mart√≠ Mayoral, a {new Date().getFullYear() - 1999}-year-old graduate in Computer Science and this is my personal page. Welcome!</p>
                                        <p>I was born in Barcelona and I have lived there since.</p>
                                        <p>I have developed this web page to let businesses know more about me. CV's are good, but sometimes are not enough to show everything about oneself.
                                            I have also worked on this webpage as an oportunity to learn more about creating webpages using ReacJs, whilst looking for a job in 2021.</p>
                                        <p>Job wise, I am looking for a strong team that I can learn from, but also make contributions to through interesting and challenging work.
                                            My preference is working within the gaming industry, but that is not mandatory.</p>
